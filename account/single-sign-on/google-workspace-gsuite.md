  Several of our customers use Google Workspace (GSuite) as their SSO provider.
  Appetize support Google Workspace as an SSO provider, using the SAML protocol.

# Google Workspace (GSuite)

For setup instructions, we recommend clients first follow our SAML instructions here:

{% content-ref url="saml.md" %}
[saml.md](saml.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once basic SAML integration has been set up, there are a few additional steps required in order for a user's assigned roles to be contained in the SAML response from your server.
