# Invite your team

## Username and Password

Appetize supports regular  username and password logins by _default_. As an admin user, you can invite users and manage roles directly from the [**Organization → Team Management**](https://appetize.io/organization/team) page.

### Inviting Users

1. Navigate to the [**Team Management**](https://appetize.io/organization/team) screen.
2. In the **Invite new members** section, you can:
   * Enter **multiple email addresses** in one field to assign them all the same role.
   *   Or click **+ Add More** to add separate email groups with different roles.\

3. Use the dropdown next to each email group to assign a role:
   * **Viewer** – Can only run uploaded apps.
   * **Developer** – Upload apps and manage app settings.
   *   **Admin** – View account page, edit billing, manage users, and change account settings.\

4. Click **Send Invites** to send all invitations at once.

Once a user is added to your account, all their existing and future uploaded apps will be linked to this account.
{% endhint %}

### Managing Roles and Team Members

After users accept their invitations, you can update their roles or remove them from the team:

1. Scroll to the **Existing Members** section.
2. Use the dropdown next to each user’s name to change their role.
3. To remove a user, click the **⊖** icon next to their row.

| User Role | Permissions                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin     | View account page, edit billing, manage users, and change account settings |
| Developer | Upload apps and manage app settings                                        |

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

On our Enterprise plans, you can take advantage of our Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations for seamless user management on Appetize. Visit our [documentation](single-sign-on.md) for more details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Roles for SSO users are managed through your identity provider. You do not need to assign or update them manually in Appetize.
{% endhint %}
