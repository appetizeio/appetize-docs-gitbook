# Invite your team

## Username and Password

Regular username/password login is available out of box. As an admin user, you have the ability to invite users and manage user roles through your [**Organization -> Team Management**](https://appetize.io/organization/team) Page.

Simply navigate to the **Invitations** section and add all the user emails that you would like to invite:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Users must accept the invite before joining the account
{% endhint %}

Once a user is added to your account, all their existing and future uploaded apps will be linked to this account.

You can also adjust the role of each account by navigating down to the **User Roles** section and selecting the appropriate role checkbox:

| User Role | Permissions                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin     | View account page, edit billing, manage users, and change account settings |
| Developer | Upload apps and manage app settings                                        |

To **delete** an account, select the dustbin next to the account you want to remove.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

On our Enterprise plans, you can take advantage of our Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations for seamless user management on Appetize. Visit our [documentation](single-sign-on.md) for more details.
