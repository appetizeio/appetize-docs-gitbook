# Testing

Appetize offers a [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) integration for a testing environment with the JavaScript SDK to test your apps. This allows you to see the device running tests on an Appetize device while benefitting from the many tools that Playwright offers, such as the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro), [CI configurations](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci), and the [VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are unfamiliar with Playwright, we recommend reading through their [Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to get an idea of how it works and what tools it makes available.
