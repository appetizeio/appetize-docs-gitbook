# Playwright

We offer a [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) integration that uses our Javascript SDK to test your apps. If you are unfamiliar with Playwright, we recommend reading through their [Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to get an idea of how it works and what tools it makes available.

## Why Playwright?

Playwright provides a great experience for automating tests on a web browser. We use the web browser to preview the device and load our Javascript SDK, allowing you to write tests for the device inside of a Playwright testing environment. This means you are able to record your tests with the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro), [run tests on CI](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro), and even use their [VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode).
