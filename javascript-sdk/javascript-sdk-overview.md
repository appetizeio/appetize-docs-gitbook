# Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Javascript SDK is **currently in beta** and is subject to breaking changes.
{% endhint %}

Our Javascript SDK offers an API to programmatically interact with Appetize devices. This allows you to automate interactions with the device, verify app behavior, and more.

### Here are some examples of what you can do:

{% content-ref url="use-cases/log-in-with-username-and-password.md" %}
[log-in-with-username-and-password.md](use-cases/log-in-with-username-and-password.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="use-cases/swipe-a-pattern-to-unlock-an-android-device.md" %}
[swipe-a-pattern-to-unlock-an-android-device.md](use-cases/swipe-a-pattern-to-unlock-an-android-device.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="use-cases/open-a-deeplink-and-make-sure-analytics-api-calls-happen.md" %}
[open-a-deeplink-and-make-sure-analytics-api-calls-happen.md](use-cases/open-a-deeplink-and-make-sure-analytics-api-calls-happen.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="use-cases/save-screenshots-of-an-app-in-multiple-languages.md" %}
[save-screenshots-of-an-app-in-multiple-languages.md](use-cases/save-screenshots-of-an-app-in-multiple-languages.md)
