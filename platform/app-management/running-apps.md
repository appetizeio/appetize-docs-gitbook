## Accessing your App Page

#### Latest Build

You can access the latest build associated with your app by making use of your app identifier and platform in the URL e.g.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```url
https://appetize.io/apps/{platform}/{appId}
```
{% endcode %}

Alternatively you can go to your [Apps](https://appetize.io/apps) page and click **play** on the app you want to run.

#### Specific Build

You can access a specific build of your app by making use of your buildId (or previously known as publicKey) in the URL e.g.

```
https://appetize.io/app/{buildId}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are still using our v1 API, the buildId and the publicKey will be interchangeable e.g.

```
https://appetize.io/app/{publicKey|buildId}
```
{% endhint %}

Alternatively you can go to your [Apps](https://appetize.io/apps) page and select the App with which the build is associated. From here you can access the individual builds as explained [here](listing-apps.md#app-builds-page).
