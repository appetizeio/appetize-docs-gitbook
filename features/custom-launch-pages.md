Customers can create highly customized integrations using Appetize virtual devices, thanks to our [embedding](../platform/embedding-apps.md), [Query Parameter](../platform/query-params-reference.md) support, and [JavaScript SDK](../javascript-sdk/).

For convenience, we also provide templated "launch pages" that can provide a simple bookmark-friendly page for your team. For Enterprise customers, Appetize can host this page and display it in the side menu for easy access. We are happy to assist you in designing and implementing such as page for your specific business use.
