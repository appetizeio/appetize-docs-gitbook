# Custom Launch Pages

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom Launch Pages is only available on our Enterprise plans. [Contact us](https://appetize.io/contact-us) to learn more.

Customers can create highly customized integrations using Appetize virtual devices, thanks to our [embedding](../platform/embedding-apps.md), [Query Parameter](../platform/query-params-reference.md) support, and [JavaScript SDK](../javascript-sdk/).

For convenience, we also provide templated "launch pages" that can provide a simple bookmark-friendly page for your team. We are happy to assist you in designing and implementing such as page for your specific business use.
