# Custom Branding

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom Branding is only available on our Premium and Enterprise plans. [Contact us](https://appetize.io/contact-us) to learn more.
{% endhint %}

Appetize offers a fully White Label solution. This includes:

* [Custom Domain](custom-branding.md#custom-domain)
* Removal of all Appetize Branding
* [Pre-Launch & Post-Session Graphics](custom-branding.md#pre-launch-and-post-session-graphics)
* [Custom Loading Animations](custom-branding.md#custom-loading-animations)
* Custom Device Chrome

## Custom Domain

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example Custom Domain</p></figcaption></figure>

If you have a custom domain, the app links you share and embed will display your domain name instead of `appetize.io`. For example, if your domain is `preview.example.com`, that's how the app and embed links will appear.

To enable this feature, you'll need to set up a CNAME record that points your desired domain or subdomain to `whitelabel.appetize.io`.

Once setup, please [contact us](mailto:support@appetize.io) to finish the configuration.

Appetize uses industry standard [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL/TLS configuration of your domain.

## Pre-Launch & Post-Session Graphics

From your Appetize [Dashboard](https://appetize.io/apps), select `manage` under one of your uploaded apps.

From there, you will see options to customize the Pre-Launch and Post-Session Graphics.

## Custom Loading Animations

Appetize supports personalized loading animations. To enable this, you can provide a link to a hosted responsive webpage that we'll embed as an `iFrame` during the loading process.

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/martinvd/pen/xbQJom" %}
Sample Loading Animation on CodePen from[ ](https://codepen.io/martinvd)[Martin van Driel](https://codepen.io/martinvd)
{% endembed %}

We have hosted this simple webpage [here](https://appetizeio-static.s3.amazonaws.com/loading\_example.html). A page like this can be specified as your custom loading animation, and may contain any of your branding you would like.

Once setup, please [contact us](mailto:support@appetize.io) to finish the configuration.
