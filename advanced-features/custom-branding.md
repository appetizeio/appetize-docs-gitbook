# Custom branding

With our Premium and Enterprise plans, Appetize.io offers a fully white label solution. This includes:

* Custom domain
* Removal of all Appetize.io branding
* Pre-launch & post-session graphics
* Custom loading animations
* Custom device chrome

### Custom domain

With a custom domain, the app links you share and embed will appear as your domain name, eg. _preview.example.com_ rather than _appetize.io_. To enable, please set up a CNAME record for your desired domain or subdomain pointing to _whitelabel.appetize.io_. 

Once setup, please contact us to finish the configuration. Appetize.io uses industry standard [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL/TLS configuration of your domain. 

### Pre-launch & post-session graphics

From your [Appetize.io Dashboard](https://appetize.io/dashboard), please click the "manage" link for one of your uploaded apps. From there, you will see options to customize the pre-launch and post-session graphics. 

### Custom loading animations

To support custom loading animations, you may provide a link to a hosted responsive webpage which we will embed as an iFrame during the loading process. 

For example, we found a sample loading animation at [https://codepen.io/martinvd/pen/xbQJom](https://codepen.io/martinvd/pen/xbQJom). We have hosted this simple webpage at [https://appetizeio-static.s3.amazonaws.com/loading\_example.html](https://appetizeio-static.s3.amazonaws.com/loading_example.html). A page like this can be specified as your custom loading animation, and may contain any of your branding you would like.
