Appetize.io supports SSO integrations using either OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) or SAML.

Once SSO is enabled for your account, all user access and role assignments are managed entirely by your SSO provider. 

### Role assignments

| Role | Permissions |
| :--- | :--- |
| appetize\_user | Can only run uploaded apps. |
| appetize\_developer | Can upload apps, delete apps, manage app settings. |
| appetize\_admin | Can manage account settings, download usage reports, download audit logs. |
