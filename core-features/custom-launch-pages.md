# Custom launch pages

Our various embed and cross-document messaging options enable you to create a customized "launch page" front-end for your apps. We are happy to assist you in designing and implementing such as page for your specific business use.

Please find a sample launch page using our demo app at [https://uswest.appetize.io/sample-launch-page](https://uswest.appetize.io/sample-launch-page).

We've also written this sample launch page in plain JavaScript which can be seen in a JSFiddle at [https://jsfiddle.net/appetize/4g7fszrn/](https://jsfiddle.net/appetize/4g7fszrn/) and the complete source can be downloaded at [https://s3.amazonaws.com/appetizeio-static/launchsample.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appetizeio-static/launchsample.html). Feel free to copy, modify, or adapt for your own needs in any way you'd like.
