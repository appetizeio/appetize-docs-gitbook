# Custom launch pages

Our playback, embedding, and cross-document messages enable customers to create highly customized integrations using Appetize.io virtual devices.&#x20;

For convenience, we also provide templated "launch pages" that can provide a simple bookmark-friendly page for your team. We are happy to assist you in designing and implementing such as page for your specific business use.

Please find a sample launch page using our demo app at [https://uswest.appetize.io/sample-launch-page](https://uswest.appetize.io/sample-launch-page).&#x20;

We've also written this sample launch page in plain JavaScript which can be seen in a JSFiddle at [https://jsfiddle.net/appetize/4g7fszrn/](https://jsfiddle.net/appetize/4g7fszrn/) and the complete source can be downloaded at [https://appetizeio-static.s3.amazonaws.com/launchsample.html](https://appetizeio-static.s3.amazonaws.com/launchsample.html). Feel free to copy, modify, or adapt for your own needs in any way you'd like.
