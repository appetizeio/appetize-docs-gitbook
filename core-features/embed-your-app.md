# Embed your app

You may use an iFrame to embed your app into any HTML. The same query parameters as the app links are supported.

Simply replace _https://appetize.io/**app**/&lt;public key&gt;_ with _https://appetize.io/**embed**/&lt;public key&gt;_ to generate a clean link you can embed into your website as an iFrame. 

```markup
<iframe
  src="https://appetize.io/embed/<PUBLIC KEY>?device=iphone8&scale=100&autoplay=false&orientation=portrait&deviceColor=black"
  width="378px" height="800px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```
