# Enterprise Hosting Options

Appetize offers multiple hosting options to cater to all the different needs and preferences of our Enterprise clients. Whether you're looking for the scalability of our Public Cloud, the enhanced privacy and security  of a Private Cloud, or considering self-hosting, understanding the differences between these options is important for making an informed decision.

## Public Cloud

The Public Cloud option uses Appetize's shared cloud environment, offering a flexible and affordable way to manage iOS and Android devices. It's perfect for enterprises that need to quickly deploy and scale their mobile management solutions using our default customization options.

## Private Cloud

The Private Cloud option gives you a dedicated instance managed by Appetize on separate hardware, offering enhanced privacy and security. This solution allows for extensive customization, including custom device images and networking configurations. It's ideal for organizations that need higher security and want to tailor the environment to their specific needs.

## Self-Hosting

Self-Hosting lets enterprises manage their infrastructure using their own on-premises hardware or cloud services like AWS. This option is particularly appealing for organizations with very strict security requirements. While it offers the same level of customization as the Private Cloud, self-hosting involves significant management and setup costs. Enterprises must handle deployment, maintenance, security updates, and scaling themselves, leading to bigger overhead.
