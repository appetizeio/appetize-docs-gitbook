# Record Tests (experimental)

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an experimental feature and may change or be removed in the future
{% endhint %}

Tests can be generated by recording your own interactions with the device through the browser.&#x20;

Simply add `await session.record()` anywhere in your test and then run your test in headed mode (`npx playwright test --headed`)

```javascript
test('plays back my interactions', async ({ session }) => {
    await session.record()
})
```

Playwright will pause at `session.record()` and any interactions you make on the device will be put here.&#x20;

Once you are finished, click the Resume button on the Playwright Inspector:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/playwright-inspector.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Image of Playwright Inspector window</p></figcaption></figure>

You will see that `session.record()` has been replaced with your interactions:

```javascript
test('plays back my interactions', async ({ session }) => {
  // Recorded using session.record()
  // 1. click on element with class "android.widget.Button"
  // 2. click on element with class "android.widget.TextView"
  // 3. click on element with class "android.widget.Button"
  await session.playActions([
   ...
  ])
})
```

Run the test again and it will replay the recording.
